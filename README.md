**[1]**

YouaskService is the default plug-in service of the system.

In the ajaxMain function of the \Addons\YouaskService\Controller\IndexController.class.php file:

![1.png](./img/1.png)

Line 138 gets the time variable submitted by post
Line 144 splices the time variable into the SQL variable
Line 152 passes SQL variables into where variables, and line 153 queries the database
The injection is caused by the use of splicing, and line 154 displays the queried data.

Post requests the following data:
```

In the showExternalPic function of \Addons\YouaskService\Controller\IndexController.class.php:

![3.png](./img/3.png)

Line 238 gets the data to be requested through the url variable
Line 248 requests data via php's curl protocol

request ```view-source:http://127.0.0.1/index.php?s=/addon/YouaskService/index/showExternalPic/wecha_id/1/token/2/&url=file:///etc/passwd```

Through the vulnerability we read the contents of /etc/passwd:

**[3]**

In the param function of \Addons\Diy\Controller\DiyController.class.php:

![6.png](./img/6.png)

Line 106 will cache the contents into the file via the S function of thinkphp.
When submitting the page_id parameter value is 1
The file name is md5(diy_1),/Runtime/Temp/1dd633b3128a336438a6a99b6b18980e.php

And because there is no restriction on the input data, the executable code can be inserted by line break, resulting in code execution.

Post requests the following data:
